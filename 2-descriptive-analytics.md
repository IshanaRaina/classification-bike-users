### Effect of Precipitation

Weather has quite a big role to play in :bike: rides. As seen in the line charts below, the amount of precipitation is inversely proportional to the count of trips being taken. The main highlight of the charts is not the actual numbers but the relationship between `Precipitation (inches)` and `Trip Count`. Therefore, no values have been plotted.
