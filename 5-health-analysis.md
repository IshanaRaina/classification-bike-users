We all know that there is a direct dependence of bike riding on the health of the users and this fact is further exploited as shown below. 

The following information is extracted from the most popular route (refer to [Descriptive Analytics](2-descriptive-analytics.md#Station-and-Route-Information)):

- Distance between the 2 stations is 0.5 miles.
- Average time taken to cover the route is 7 minutes by bike.
- Using the distance and time metrics, the average speed for a user to cover that route is estimated to be 4.54 miles/hour. 
- Using the zip code under consideration (94107), we found its demographics to be: 
    - Average age of a living person is 25 â€“ 34 years
    - Less than 63.2% of people are overweight or obese

Feeding this data into an online calorie calculator, it is observed that a person riding the most popular route would **burn 32 calories on average**.
