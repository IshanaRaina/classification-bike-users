## Station Distribution :bike:

In order to optimize the bikes that are already out there and to add more bikes, docks and/or stations to the existing network, it is important to first analyze the current usage. Superimposing the dock count numbers over the map of the Bay Area is one of the easiest ways to quickly visualize station density as compared to population density. On drilling down, we can also compare the dock density to the population density per station (each cross is a station.)

According to the legend in the gif above:
- **RED is less**
    - Red areas/patches on the map indicate low population density. Also on drilling into a particular city, red crosses stand for low dock counts in the station.
- **GREEN is more**
    - Green areas/patches on the map indicate high population density. Also on drilling into a particular city, green crosses stand for high dock counts in the station.

> Take San Francisco for example. Similar recommendations can be made for the other 4 cities. 

San Francisco accounts for the highest number of stations, constituting 53.8% of the entire Bay Area Bike Share system. On drilling down into its stations, it is observed that there are stations with high dock counts (green crosses) in densely populated areas. However, there are also stations with low dock counts in densely populated areas. These stations can be part of a target list where dock counts need to be increased. 

Further analysis can be done on the number of bike rides in and around the area in order to make more concrete recommendations regarding the increase in bikes and docks.
